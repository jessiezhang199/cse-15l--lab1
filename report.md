My week1 lab report
This week we learn how to use terminal to clone a now file in our own github account. After we clone it, the file will appear to our page immediately and we can use some basic method to open it. 
The command cd is use to go with a path to a directory. However, when you use cd with no arguments, it will return to the beginning - with not directory or file. It will have no change if we did not have path to any directory or file. The first screenshot I provide is the the sample of using the command cd without arguments. Because we did not tell the computer what to open, so it just go back to no path. For a simple diretory, we just need to know the name of the file and type it after we type cd with a space. It will easily appear on our title. Computer will follow what we tell he to do if it is a directory that it could go farther. However, if we try to use it to open a file it will fail and said that this is not a directory. A example screenshot is provide named 3 in my repository. If there is no directories can go farther, computer will warn us.
Another command is ls, which is useful when we did not know or forgot the directories, and it will shows us all the files and directories that availeble in the paths that we are now. It really helps us to keep going on our path. If there is no arguments behind ls command, it will list all the files and directories at the path we are. If we add a apth directory with ls command, and it is the directory that we can use cd to access, it will open the file list of that path instead of the path we are now. But if the directory we could not access by the path we are now, the computer will be warning for no access. That is means that paths and directories is also really important to the ls command. If the computer can access, it could work. But if it could not, it will return the message of no access. If we use the command with a path to a file as argument, it will return the name of the file. I think because the computer could not find any directory, so it just return the name of the file to show the programmer that is no way to go any farther.
