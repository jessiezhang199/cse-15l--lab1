My week1 lab report

This week we learn how to use terminal to clone a now file in our own github account. After we clone it, the file will appear to our page immediately and we can use some basic method to open it. 
The command cd is use to open the file and go with a path to a directory. However, when you use cd with no arguments, it will return to the beginning - with not directory or file. It will have no change if we did not have path to any directory or file. The first screenshot I provide is the the sample of using the command cd without arguments. For a simple diretory, we just need to know the name of the file and type it after we type cd with a space. It will easily appear on our title.
